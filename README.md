# Overview

My major is Computer Science and I minor in Machine Learning. I thought it would be fun to use machine learning on a White Wine dataset I found on UCI Data Repository. The intent of the model is to be able to predict what makes a good quality of White wine with the features provided in this dataset. I learned a great deal by implementing different models to see what will get me to a higher accuracy score.

# Future Work

* I would like to improve on getting a higher accuracy score
* Try to implement undersampling to see If I could get a better score
* Try understanding the data and what each feature is to analyze and process the data better
